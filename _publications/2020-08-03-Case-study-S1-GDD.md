excerpt: '**TLDR:** Given the importance of maize in Serbia, this study used Sentinel-1 SAR data and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) method to monitor key growth stages for maize fields during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. The combined approach allowed for estimating crucial stages like tasseling and silking despite weather variations, with radar backscatter trends aligning closely with agronomic estimates, demonstrating global applicability.'
