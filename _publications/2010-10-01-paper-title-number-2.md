excerpt: 'TLDR: This study explored temporal transfer learning for crop mapping in Vojvodina, Serbia, using SAR satellite imagery and ground truth data from 2017-2020. By focusing on smaller buffer zones around Novi Sad (20, 25, and 30 km) for retraining, the CNN-1D model achieved higher accuracy than training from scratch, with F1 scores of 74%, 79%, and 83%, respectively. Results suggest that transfer learning can reduce the need for extensive ground truth data collection, but accuracy may be affected by the uniformity of sampling areas, especially when compared to randomly distributed samples across the test region.'
