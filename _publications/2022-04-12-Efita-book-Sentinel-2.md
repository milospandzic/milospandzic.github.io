excerpt: 'This study explores the fusion of sensor data for agricultural applications by comparing two novel crop-monitoring approaches: the Plant-O-Meter, a multispectral handheld sensor, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Both sensors, used to track maize growth in 2018, showed positive correlations in vegetation indices, underscoring their combined potential in precision agriculture.'
