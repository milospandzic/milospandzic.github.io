excerpt: '**TLDR:** This study assessed the response of ten winter wheat cultivars to stressful halomorphic soils in Banat, Serbia, examining phenotypic variability and genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) under control and phosphor gypsum treatments. Using AMMI models, results showed that the first two IPCA components accounted for 70% of GEI variation, with IPCA1 explaining a substantial portion of grain weight and harvest index, revealing differential responses among wheat genotypes to soil stress and treatments.'
