excerpt: 'TLDR: The paper presents an exhaustive comparison of different approaches for crop mapping using Sentinel-1 satellite data. The study evaluated three distinct algorithms - Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Transformer - in two scenarios: transferring a model from a historical dataset (2017-2020) to a target season (2021), and using a traditional approach with limited ground truth data from the target season.The results showed that the transfer learning approach can yield modest crop mapping performance (78% F1 score) without any target season ground truth data. However, as more target season data becomes available (120-720 parcels), the transfer learning approach can achieve 84-86% F1 score, while the traditional approach can reach up to 88% F1 score with around 720 parcels of ground truth data.The study highlights the potential of transfer learning in crop mapping when little to no ground truth data is available for the target season, but also demonstrates that the traditional approach can catch up and even surpass the transfer learning approach as more target season data is collected. The study contributes to the field of agricultural monitoring and management by providing a practical and efficient solution for crop mapping using Sentinel-1 data, regardless of cloud cover.'
