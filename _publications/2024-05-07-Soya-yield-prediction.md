excerpt: 'TLDR: This study evaluated a machine learning system for within-field soybean yield prediction using Sentinel-2 multispectral images and soil parameters, focusing on farms in Upper Austria from 2018 to 2020. A new Polygon-Pixel Interpolation method optimized yield monitor and satellite image alignment, with Stochastic Gradient Descent performing best, achieving a mean absolute error of 4.36 kg/pixel and a correlation coefficient of 0.83%.'
