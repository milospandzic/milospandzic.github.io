excerpt: '**TLDR:** This study tested a new low-cost, active multispectral device called the Plant-O-Meter, comparing it with the GreenSeeker canopy sensor for maize monitoring in nitrogen-fertilized experimental fields. Results showed that both sensors provided similar NDVI readings, particularly between the V7 and V8 growth stages, highlighting the Plant-O-Meter’s potential for accurate canopy assessments and real-time variable rate fertilization.'
