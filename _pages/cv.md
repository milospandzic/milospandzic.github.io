Work experience
======
* _April 2018 - Present_: **Research Assistant** @ BioSense Institute, University of Novi Sad <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg/255px-Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png" alt="Austrian Flag" width="20" height="16">
  * Processed radar & optical satellite data for geospatial analytics in agriculture (crop monitoring) and disaster management sector (burned area mapping, fire & flood detection)
  * Developed ML/DL pipelines for crop mapping & crop health monitoring
  * Contributed to successful funding proposals
  * Mentored students during internships

* _June 2016 - December 2017_: **Researcher** @ Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI/NLS) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Finland.svg/255px-Flag_of_Finland.svg.png" alt="Austrian Flag" width="20" height="16">
  * Delivered EO solutions across urban, agricultural, and forestry domains, contributing to international projects funded by the Academy of Finland and the European Space Agency (ESA)
  * Developed satellite-based change detection methods for urban areas (later integrated with UAV and mobile LiDAR for detailed mapping)
  * Implemented methods for clear-cut detection in forestry
  * Processed and analyzed multispectral satellite imagery to monitor crop development
  
* _September 2015 - December 2015_: **Guest Researcher** @ TU Vienna, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformatics <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg" alt="Austrian Flag" width="20" height="16">
  * Assessed the geometric quality of Sentinel-2 imagery shortly after its launch by ESA. Extracted and compared linear features (roads, riverbanks) from Sentinel-2 and very-high-resolution aerial imagery, performing statistical analysis of matching scores
  * Awarded an OeAD scholarship (Government of Austria) for this work, which was further developed into a master thesis: “Assessment of the Geometric Quality of Sentinel-2 Data”
